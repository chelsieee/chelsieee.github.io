# COVID-19-DASHBOARD

Site published at https://chelsieee.github.io/

using 2 API (recommended by Postman) to fetch COVID-19 real time data: -1 API for all continent -1 API for all countries

construct the basic covid-19 data for each country/continent from Jquery( nothing hard code)

Dynamically Utilize CSS/Bootstrap to polish the applicate and realise mobile compatibility

Refering to Chart.js to visualise data retrieved from API into a bar chart

WORK ON IN FUTURE: use a more reliable API construct basic element with class and use constructor function to create basic class and inheritant class in order to avoid duplication of codes
